<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p style="margin-top: 10px;"> What long time to not update my recent progress! Recently, I have received my Master's degree of Hunan University, which means the end of my Master's period. It is a good news that I will start my PhD life at McGill in this August. I believe that it must be an wonderful and challenging travel for me. Anyway, let me enjoy my research life. <br>
  After graduating from Hunan University, I continue to focus on my research fields, such as pose estimation, unsupervised segmentation, and so on. In these research topics, I try to find more researchers to cooperate with me to accelerate the research process. Therefore, there exists a lot of thanks for my friends, Dr. Xu Shaopeng and Dai Yu, who play significant roles in my research life. A lot of thanks for them, again!<br>
  In the future PhD period, I will explore more research topics about robotic manipulation. I believe that removing the burden on workers is the forever topic of modern society. Let robots be our friends!<br>
  Of course, if you were interested in any aspect of my research, please contact with me at: huiguang.wang@mail.mcgill.ca
