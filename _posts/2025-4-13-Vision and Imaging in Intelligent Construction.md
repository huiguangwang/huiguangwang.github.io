# üìò Course Homepage: Visual Sensing and Imaging in Intelligent Construction

This course introduces the fundamentals of camera imaging, 3D vision technologies, coordinate system transformations in robotics, and practical applications of vision systems in the context of intelligent construction. It bridges the gap between sensing principles and engineering implementation.

## üß† 1. Camera Imaging Principles

Cameras project the 3D world onto a 2D image plane. Key concepts include:

- **Pinhole Camera Model**:  
  A basic model ignoring distortion. The projection is described by:

  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  u \\
  v \\
  1
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  K \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
  X_c \\
  Y_c \\
  Z_c
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

  Where \( K \) is the intrinsic matrix, \( (u, v) \) are pixel coordinates, and \( (X_c, Y_c, Z_c) \) are coordinates in the camera frame.



- **Camera Intrinsics and Distortion**:
  - Focal length and principal point
  - Radial and tangential distortion

- **Image Sensor Sampling**:
  - CMOS / CCD
  - RGB and grayscale image acquisition

## üì∑ 2. Introduction to 3D Camera Technologies

3D cameras capture both color and depth information. Four common principles are:

### ‚úÖ 2.1 Stereo Vision

- Simulates human vision using **two cameras**
- Calculates **disparity** and triangulates depth
- Depends on reliable feature matching

### ‚úÖ 2.2 Structured Light

- Projects **known patterns** onto the object
- Camera captures the deformation of the pattern to compute depth
- High accuracy, suitable for static scenes
- Used in Kinect v1

### ‚úÖ 2.3 Time of Flight (TOF)

- Emits modulated light and measures **travel time**
- Directly obtains depth for each pixel
- Real-time performance, suitable for dynamic scenes

### ‚úÖ 2.4 Laser Line Scanning

- Uses a **laser line** to scan objects line by line
- The camera captures the deformation of the line
- Suitable for high-precision industrial applications

## üîÑ 3. Coordinate Systems and Transformations

Visual systems in robotics involve four major coordinate systems:

| Coordinate System     | Description                                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Pixel Coordinate      | Origin at top-left of image, in pixels \((u, v)\) |
| Image Coordinate      | Origin at image center, in millimeters            |
| Camera Coordinate     | Origin at optical center, \(Z\)-axis points forward |
| World Coordinate      | Global reference system \((x_w, y_w, z_w)\)       |

Common transformations:

1. **Pixel ‚Üí Image Coordinates**:  
   Considering principal point and pixel size.

2. **Image ‚Üí Camera Coordinates**:  
   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
   X_c \\
   Y_c \\
   Z_c
   \end{bmatrix}
   = Z \cdot K^{-1} \cdot
   \begin{bmatrix}
   u \\
   v \\
   1
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

3. **Camera ‚Üí World Coordinates**:  
   $$
   \mathbf{X}_w = R \cdot \mathbf{X}_c + t
   $$

Where \( R \) and \( t \) are the extrinsic transformation matrices.
