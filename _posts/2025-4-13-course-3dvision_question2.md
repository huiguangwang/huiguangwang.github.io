# Question 2: Relationship Between Principal Point and Image Dimensions

## 📌 Theoretical Relationship

In theory, the **principal point** refers to the intersection of the camera's **optical axis** with the image plane. This point is typically located **near the center of the image**. Thus:

```
p_x ≈ image_width / 2  
p_y ≈ image_height / 2
```

---

## 🎯 More Precise Expression

Let:

- **W** = image width  
- **H** = image height

In a pixel coordinate system (origin at top-left corner):

- If pixel centers are at integer positions:
  ```
  p_x = (W - 1) / 2  
  p_y = (H - 1) / 2
  ```

- If pixel centers are at half-integer positions:
  ```
  p_x = W / 2  
  p_y = H / 2
  ```

---

## 📸 Example

For a 1920×1080 image:

```
p_x ≈ 960  
p_y ≈ 540
```

---

## ⚠️ Practical Considerations

- The actual principal point **may deviate** from the image center
- Reasons: lens manufacturing tolerances, sensor alignment, calibration accuracy
- Calibration often returns **non-integer values** for \( p_x, p_y \)
- Offsets are more prominent in:
  - Wide-angle lenses
  - Mobile phone cameras
  - Industrial cameras

## 📐 Camera Intrinsic Matrix

The camera intrinsic matrix \( K \) is defined as:

```
K = | f_x   0   p_x |
    |  0   f_y  p_y |
    |  0    0    1  |
```

Where:

- \( f_x = f \cdot s_x \): focal length scaled in x direction  
- \( f_y = f \cdot s_y \): focal length scaled in y direction  
- \( p_x, p_y \): principal point coordinates in pixels  
- \( s_x, s_y \): number of pixels per unit distance in the x and y directions (i.e., pixel density). These are used to convert physical focal length (in mm) to pixel units.

## ✅ Summary

| Concept             | Theoretical Value                   | Practical Observation         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| \( p_x \)           | ~ image width / 2                   | Slightly offset from center   |
| \( p_y \)           | ~ image height / 2                  | May vary by a few pixels      |
| Pixel origin        | Top-left (0,0)                      | Standard in most systems      |
| Deviation reason    | Lens/sensor misalignment, distortion | Corrected via calibration     |
